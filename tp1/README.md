## Project Information

This project is a 3D interactive scene, inspired by the living room from *The Simpsons*, showcasing a variety of modeling, texturing, and lighting techniques. The project demonstrates the following features:

### Key Features

- **Multiple Camera Views**: Toggle between different camera perspectives for dynamic scene exploration.
- **3D Objects and Geometry**: The scene includes complex objects like sofas, lamps, tables, and small decorative elements, built from basic shapes like cubes, cones, and planes.
- **Materials and Textures**: Use of various materials and textures to bring realism to surfaces, from the wooden floor to patterned walls and fabric textures.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: A carefully configured lighting setup, including spotlights and ambient lighting, creates realistic shadows and highlights key objects.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user interface to control elements such as camera views, lighting, and specific object properties for a customizable experience.

### Elements

- **Flower Jars**: One decorative flower jars add a touch of color and realism to the room.
- **TV with Channel Controls**: A functional TV where users can change channels, with light emitted to simulate a realistic screen glow.
- **Creator Canvases**: Two framed canvas artworks featuring images of the scene creators.
- **Textured Rug and Table**: The rug and table are designed with custom textures to bring depth and style to the lounge area.
- **Iconic Donut**: A pink-frosted donut with sprinkles and a slice cut out, adding a nod to *The Simpsons* and visual interest on the table.
- **NURBS Newspaper**: A detailed newspaper created using NURBS modeling techniques.
- **Custom-Shaped Sofa**: A unique sofa design built with custom shapes to replicate the iconic *Simpsons* sofa.
- **Directional Lamps**: Several lamps are placed strategically, each using directional lighting to highlight different areas in the room.
- **Curved Spring**: A spring created with curves.
- **Window with Sunlight Simulation**: A large window that brings in simulated sunlight using directional light to create a natural ambiance.
- **Sliding Curtains**: Two curtains made with NURBS, designed to slide open and close, allowing users to control light exposure.
- **Vase**: Decorative Vase
