## Project Information

This project is a 3D interactive scene simulating a base on mars, created by using the Scene Graph tecnique

### Key Features

- **Multiple Camera Views**: Toggle between different camera perspectives for dynamic scene exploration.
- **3D Objects and Geometry**: The scene includes complex objects like sofas, lamps, tables, and small decorative elements, built from basic shapes like cubes, cones, and planes.
- **Materials and Textures**: Use of various materials and textures to bring realism to surfaces, from the wooden floor to patterned walls and fabric textures.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: A carefully configured lighting setup, including spotlights and ambient lighting, creates realistic shadows and highlights key objects.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user interface to control elements such as camera views, lighting, and specific object properties for a customizable experience.

### Elements
- **Mars Base**: Multiple house and domes to simulate a base in mars
